# BG3_HonorMode
This repo I have uploaded an honor mode save which loads you into the camp during the epilogue. With this save you can get the Foehammer achievement merely by talking to Withers and completing the game. The achievement will be granted a minute or so after the credits start rolling.

# Install
You can load this save with the following steps:

* Download this repo and and extract the save from the zip file called `honormode.zip`
* Reset your profile which is located on Windows in `C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public`
    * Back up all your saves in the `Savegames` folder (Not my fault if you mess this up and don't backup your data)
    * Delete the `Public` folder under `PlayerProfiles`
    * Start BG3
    * Copy and paste the folder that you extracted earlier called `75d79626-f56e-54ab-57fc-fc465de605a2__HonourMode` into `C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\Savegames\Story`
    * You might have to relaunch BG3 after if it doesn't register that the game is there
* Load the Honor mode save
* Complete and get the achievement by talking to Withers
    * You should get the achievement after the credits start rolling within a minute or so

# Additional Info

I tested this by making a new Steam account which had no saved games, so a blank profile which is essentially the same thing as resetting your profile. I will try and test this on another with saved games and see if it works in the future. However, it might still work without resetting your profile but I did not test that. Some will see this as cheating so use as you wish but since this is a single player game I have no issue with helping others get the achievement if they can't do so.
