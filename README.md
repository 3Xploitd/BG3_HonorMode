# BG3_HonorMode
This repo I have uploaded an Honor Mode save which loads you into the camp during the epilogue. With this save you can get the Foehammer achievement merely by talking to Withers and completing the game. The achievement will be granted a minute or so after the credits start rolling.

# Install
You can load this save with the following steps:

1. Download this repo and and extract the save from the zip file called `HonorMode_Achievement.zip`
2. Copy and paste the folder that you extracted earlier called `75d79626-f56e-54ab-57fc-fc465de605a2__HonourMode` into `C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\Savegames\Story`
3. Load the Honor mode save
4. Complete and get the achievement by talking to Withers
    * You should get the achievement after the credits start rolling within a minute or so
 
I tested this with a different steam account both with a blank public profile (no saved games) and one with saved games and I was able to get the achievement after loading the newly placed save. If it doesn't work you can rename your Public profile to something like `Public_backup`. Then start BG3 and once the Public profile is recreated, place the save in `C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\Savegames\Story` and load the game (might have the restart the game to see the save). Then once you get the achievement you can delete the `Public` profile and rename your original profile back to `Public`, only do this if placing the save into your original profile did not work.


# Additional Info

Some will see this as cheating so use as you wish but since this is a single player game I have no issue with helping others get the achievement if they can't do so.
